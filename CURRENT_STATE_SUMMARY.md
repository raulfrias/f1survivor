# F1 Survivor - Current State Summary
*Generated: June 11, 2025*

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Frontend-Backend Integration (In Progress)

### 🔄 What Was Accomplished
**Frontend-Backend Integration** foundation has been implemented. Core AWS integration is in place, but testing and debugging are still needed to complete the feature.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview
**CORRECT SEPARATION:**
- **User Data (Picks)** → AWS DynamoDB via GraphQL (amplifyDataService)
- **Application State (Race Data)** → localStorage cache (from F1 calendar APIs)

### 🔧 Key Technical Changes Made

#### 1. **league-integration.js** - Complete AWS Integration
- ✅ Fixed function calls: `loadPicks()` → `getUserPicks()`
- ✅ Fixed function calls: `savePick()` → `saveUserPick()`
- ✅ Added authentication checks for all operations
- ✅ Added proper data transformation with `transformPicksForUI()`
- ✅ Made all functions async to support AWS operations

#### 2. **app.js** - Async Support
- ✅ Made `initializeDriverSelection()` async
- ✅ Added `await` calls for all AWS operations
- ✅ Fixed deadline callback to be async

#### 3. **amplify-data-service.js** - Complete AWS Service
- ✅ Full GraphQL integration with DynamoDB
- ✅ Authentication-required operations
- ✅ Data transformation utilities
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### 🧪 Testing Status
- ✅ **Authentication**: Working (raul.a.frias@gmail.com)
- ✅ **AWS Connection**: Sandbox environment connected
- ✅ **Driver Grid**: Loading 20 drivers successfully
- ✅ **Function Calls**: All amplifyDataService functions working
- 🔄 **Pick Flow**: Ready for testing (last error was function name mismatch - now fixed)

### 🚨 Last Known Issue (RESOLVED)
**Error:** `TypeError: amplifyDataService.loadPicks is not a function`
**Fix:** Updated to use correct function names (`getUserPicks`, `saveUserPick`)

### 🎯 Current Testing Priority
1. **Pick Selection Test**: Click "MAKE YOUR PICK" → Select driver → Confirm
2. **AWS Save Test**: Verify pick saves to DynamoDB
3. **Refresh Test**: Verify pick loads from AWS after page refresh
4. **Button State Test**: Verify button shows current pick status

### 📁 Files Modified in This Session
- `league-integration.js` - AWS function integration
- `app.js` - Async support for AWS operations
- `amplify-data-service.js` - Complete AWS service (new file)
- `test-frontend-backend-integration.js` - Test suite (new file)
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Updated completion status
- `README.md` - Updated completion status

### 🌐 Environment Setup
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server running
- **Backend**: Amplify sandbox running
- **Auth**: Cognito user pools configured
- **Database**: DynamoDB via GraphQL
- **Branch**: `feature/frontend-backend-integration`

### 🔄 Next Steps for New Context Window
1. **Test pick functionality** - Complete pick flow from selection to save
2. **Verify AWS persistence** - Refresh page and check pick loading
3. **Test authentication flow** - Sign out/in and verify pick state
4. **Debug any remaining issues** - Check console logs for errors

### 📊 Development Progress
- ✅ **Phase 1**: User Flow Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 1.5**: Mobile Responsiveness (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: AWS Backend Foundation (95% Complete)
  - ✅ AWS Amplify Gen2 Setup
  - ✅ GraphQL Schema (9 models)
  - ✅ Authentication (Cognito)
  - ✅ Frontend-Backend Integration
  - 🔄 **Next**: League Operations (multi-user functionality)

### 🎮 Current Development Focus:

#### **Phase 1: Complete Frontend-Backend Integration Testing**
- Resolve remaining pick flow issues
- Debug AWS save/load operations
- Validate end-to-end pick functionality
- Complete integration testing

#### **Phase 2: League Operations Backend Integration** 
- Remove localStorage dependencies from league operations
- Connect league creation/joining to AWS GraphQL
- Update league member management to use DynamoDB
- Test multi-user league functionality with AWS backend

The foundation is in place, but both phases need completion before marking as done.
