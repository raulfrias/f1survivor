# F1 Survivor - Change Control Process

## Overview
This document establishes the structured approach for managing feature development and scope changes in the F1 Survivor project.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Controlled Flexibility** (Option 2)
- Implementation plan scope is **fixed** for each feature
- Minor enhancements **allowed** if they meet criteria
- Major changes **require explicit discussion** and plan updates
- Regular check-ins to course-correct if needed

### 2. **Single Source of Truth**
```
HIERARCHY:
1. ROADMAP.md = High-level vision and phases
2. Implementation Plans = Detailed technical specs (THIS IS LAW)
3. Daily Progress = What we're doing today

RULE: Lower levels cannot contradict higher levels
```

## Change Classification

### **MINOR CHANGES** ✅ (Allowed without approval)
**Criteria:** Must meet ALL of the following:
- ✅ Don't change the timeline
- ✅ Don't add significant complexity
- ✅ Improve user experience or code quality
- ✅ Are documented in commit message

**Examples:**
- Enhanced error messages
- Small UI improvements (styling, animations)
- Performance optimizations within scope
- Additional logging or validation
- Code refactoring for maintainability

**Process:**
1. Agent mentions the improvement during development
2. Implement if it meets all criteria
3. Document in commit message with "BONUS:" prefix

### **MAJOR CHANGES** ❌ (Require explicit approval)
**Criteria:** Any change that:
- ❌ Changes the timeline or complexity
- ❌ Adds new functional requirements
- ❌ Changes data models or architecture
- ❌ Affects other features or dependencies
- ❌ Changes user interface significantly

**Examples:**
- Adding new features not in scope
- Changing GraphQL schema
- Adding real-time capabilities
- New UI components or pages
- Integration with new services

**Process:**
1. Agent identifies potential major change
2. Explicit discussion: "This would be a major change - should we update the plan first or defer to backlog?"
3. Decision made before proceeding
4. If approved: Update implementation plan FIRST, then proceed

## Feature Development Process

### **Before Starting Any Feature:**
1. ✅ **Review Implementation Plan** - Understand exact scope and requirements
2. ✅ **Confirm Definition of Done** - Know when to stop working
3. ✅ **Identify Dependencies** - Ensure prerequisites are met
4. ✅ **Estimate Timeline** - Realistic time commitment

### **During Feature Development:**
1. ✅ **Follow the Plan** - Stick to defined scope and requirements
2. ✅ **Document Deviations** - Note any minor enhancements in commits
3. ✅ **Ask Before Major Changes** - Pause for approval on scope expansions
4. ✅ **Test Incrementally** - Validate each phase before proceeding

### **After Feature Completion:**
1. ✅ **Check-in Session** - Review what was built vs. what was planned
2. ✅ **Update Documentation** - Reconcile plans with reality
3. ✅ **Lessons Learned** - Identify process improvements
4. ✅ **Next Feature Planning** - Prepare for upcoming work

## Documentation Management

### **Implementation Plans**
- **Status:** Living documents that get updated with actual results
- **Format:** "PLANNED vs ACTUAL" sections showing what was delivered
- **Updates:** After each feature completion
- **Purpose:** Historical record and future planning reference

### **ROADMAP.md**
- **Status:** High-level progress tracking
- **Format:** Phase completion status and major milestones
- **Updates:** After major phase completions
- **Purpose:** Project overview and stakeholder communication

### **Commit Messages**
- **Minor enhancements:** Include "BONUS:" prefix with description
- **Major features:** Comprehensive description of what was delivered
- **Scope changes:** Note any deviations from original plan

## Quality Assurance

### **Definition of Done Enforcement**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ All functional requirements delivered
- ✅ All technical requirements satisfied
- ✅ Testing completed as specified
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ No major scope creep without approval

### **Scope Creep Prevention**
- ✅ Clear boundaries defined in implementation plans
- ✅ "Future Features" backlog for good ideas outside scope
- ✅ Regular check-ins to catch drift early
- ✅ Explicit approval required for major changes

## Roles & Responsibilities

### **User (Project Owner)**
- ✅ Approve major scope changes
- ✅ Provide feedback on feature direction
- ✅ Participate in check-in sessions
- ✅ Final decision on scope vs. timeline trade-offs

### **Agent (Developer)**
- ✅ Follow implementation plans strictly
- ✅ Identify potential scope changes early
- ✅ Implement minor enhancements within guidelines
- ✅ Document all deviations and bonus features
- ✅ Maintain quality and testing standards

## Check-in Process

### **After Each Feature Completion:**
1. **Progress Review** - What got done vs. what was planned?
2. **Scope Review** - Any deviations or additions?
3. **Quality Review** - Does it meet definition of done?
4. **Process Review** - How's our structure working?
5. **Next Feature Planning** - Confirm upcoming work scope

### **Check-in Format:**
```
FEATURE: [Feature Name]
PLANNED: [Original scope from implementation plan]
DELIVERED: [What was actually built]
BONUS FEATURES: [Any enhancements beyond scope]
ISSUES: [Any problems or deviations]
LESSONS LEARNED: [Process improvements]
NEXT: [Upcoming feature confirmation]
```

## Backlog Management

### **Future Features Backlog**
- Good ideas that arise during development
- Features requested outside current scope
- Enhancements that would require major changes
- Innovation opportunities for future phases

### **Backlog Review**
- Reviewed during check-in sessions
- Prioritized for future implementation plans
- Used to inform roadmap updates

## Success Metrics

### **Process Success:**
- ✅ Features delivered within planned scope
- ✅ Timeline estimates accurate
- ✅ Quality maintained throughout
- ✅ Documentation stays current
- ✅ Minimal scope creep or drift

### **Product Success:**
- ✅ User requirements met
- ✅ Technical requirements satisfied
- ✅ Performance benchmarks achieved
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Foundation ready for next features
