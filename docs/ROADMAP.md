### Real-time League Updates (AppSync Subscriptions) - REMOVED FROM SCOPE
**Date:** July 5, 2025
**Reason:** Scope change during development - F1 Survivor is a batch-based game where players submit picks before races and results are processed after races. Real-time updates add complexity without significant value for this game mechanic.

**What was removed:**
- Live pick submissions within leagues
- Live league member status updates  
- Real-time elimination notifications
- Live countdown synchronization across users
- Multi-user real-time functionality testing

**Impact:** Simplified development focus on core batch processing workflow.

### Auto-Pick Lambda Function - HIGH PRIORITY
**Date:** July 5, 2025
**Status:** Ready for implementation - OpenF1 API integration already completed

- [ ] Convert current JavaScript auto-pick logic to AWS Lambda
- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Integrate with OpenF1 API for qualifying results (Fixed cache-busting bug, successfully fetching real data)
- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Implement P15 fallback system in serverless environment (Tested with Spanish GP 2025: Carlos Sainz P15, Alexander Albon P16 fallback)
- [ ] Add error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Test auto-pick triggers and notifications
- [ ] **NEW:** Integrate with batch processing workflow (race end + 8hr buffer)
- [ ] **NEW:** Ensure auto-pick works for league-based picks only (no solo mode)

**Implementation Notes:** 
- Move from client-side JavaScript to server-side Lambda execution
- Trigger at race deadline automatically
- Handle P15 fallback with intelligent driver selection
- Integrate with new batch results processing system

### Pick Validation & Business Logic - MODIFIED SCOPE
**Date:** July 5, 2025
**Reason:** Scope change during development - Simplified to single elimination per league, removed solo mode complexity

- [ ] **Server-side deadline enforcement** (Essential - prevent client-side manipulation)
- [ ] **Driver already-picked validation** (Essential - prevent duplicate picks per league)
- [ ] **Batch race result processing** (NEW - process all picks after race + 8hr buffer)
- [ ] **Single-life elimination logic** (NEW - simplified from multi-life system)
- [ ] **League-specific elimination tracking** (NEW - track elimination per league only)
- [ ] **Result notification system** (NEW - email/push notifications for race outcomes)
- [ ] **Pick change validation** (NEW - allow unlimited changes before race start)
- [ ] **Multi-league pick isolation** (NEW - ensure picks don't conflict across leagues)
- [ ] **Comprehensive validation testing** (Essential - test all scenarios)

**Removed from scope:**
- Multi-life elimination tracking (Simplified to single elimination)
- Solo mode pick validation (Game is league-based only)
- Lives management system (Simplified to ACTIVE/ELIMINATED status)

**Implementation Notes:**
- All picks must be associated with a league (no null leagueId)
- Simple elimination: finish outside top 10 = eliminated from league
- Players can join multiple leagues with independent pick histories
- Batch processing after race completion + 8-hour penalty buffer

### Technical Debt Cleanup - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
**Date:** July 5, 2025
**Reason:** Scope changes during development require code cleanup and simplification

**IMPORTANT:**
> **Technical Debt Cleanup must be completed before starting Auto-Pick Lambda Function and all new backend logic.** This ensures the codebase and schema are simplified and consistent for all future features.

#### Solo Mode Removal
**Why:** Game scope changed to league-based only during development
**What to remove:**
- Remove "Solo Play" option from league selector dropdown (`league-dashboard.js`)
- Remove solo mode pick saving/loading paths (`league-integration.js`)
- Remove solo mode AWS backend calls (`amplify-data-service.js`)
- Remove solo mode references in multi-league context (`multi-league-context.js`)
- Update authentication flow to require league selection
- Remove solo mode test scenarios from test files
- Update database schema comments about null leagueId for solo play

#### Multiple Lives System Removal  
**Why:** Game complexity reduction - simplified to single elimination per league
**What to remove:**
- Remove lives-related fields from LeagueMember model (`amplify/data/resource.ts`)
  - Remove `remainingLives`, `livesUsed`, `maxLives` fields
  - Remove `LifeEvent` model entirely
- Remove lives management methods from data service (`amplify-data-service.js`)
  - Remove `updateLeagueLivesSettings()`, `getLeagueLivesConfiguration()`
  - Remove `updateMemberLives()`, `getMemberLivesStatus()`, `createLifeEvent()`
- Remove lives UI components (`league-modal-manager.js`)
  - Remove lives configuration in league settings
  - Remove lives display in member management
  - Remove `generateLivesDisplay()` method
- Remove lives test files (`tests/unit/test-lives-system-api.js`)
- Simplify LeagueMember status to ACTIVE/ELIMINATED only

**Implementation Priority:**
- **Complete all technical debt cleanup before implementing Auto-Pick Lambda Function, batch results processing, or any new backend features.**

### Week 1-2: Technical Debt Cleanup (Immediate Priority)
- **Solo Mode Removal:** Remove all solo mode functionality and UI components
- **Multiple Lives System Removal:** Simplify to single elimination per league
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove deprecated methods and update database schema
- **Testing:** Update test suites to reflect simplified game logic

### Week 3-4: Auto-Pick Lambda Function (High Priority)
- **(Depends on completion of Technical Debt Cleanup)**

- P15 fallback system with intelligent driver selection
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for reliability
- Integration with batch processing workflow

### Week 5-6: Batch Results Processing (High Priority)
- Race completion detection and 8-hour penalty buffer timer
- F1 results fetching via `race-results-api.js`
- League-specific pick processing against official results
- Single-life elimination logic and status updates
- Multi-league result processing and standings updates

### Week 7-8: Pick Validation & Business Logic (High Priority)
- Server-side deadline enforcement (no client-side manipulation)
- Driver validation and pick change logic (unlimited changes before race)
- League-specific pick isolation (no cross-league conflicts)
- Comprehensive testing suite for all scenarios

### Week 9-10: Notification System (Medium Priority)
- Email notifications for race results and eliminations
- Push notifications for mobile users
- Customizable notification preferences
- Multi-channel notification delivery

### Real-time League Updates (REMOVED FROM SCOPE - July 5, 2025)
**Reason:** Batch-based game doesn't require real-time updates. May be reconsidered in Phase 4 based on user feedback.

### AWS Amplify Gen2 Schema (Phase 2+ - Simplified Single-Life)
```typescript
// GraphQL Schema Definition (Updated July 5, 2025)
const schema = a.schema({
  UserProfile: a.model({
    userId: a.id().required(),
    displayName: a.string().required(),
    username: a.string().required(),
    email: a.string().required(),
    googleId: a.string(),
    activeLeagues: a.string().array(),     // Array of league IDs (unlimited)
    defaultLeague: a.string(),             // Primary league for quick access
    totalSurvivedRaces: a.integer().default(0),
    preferredTeam: a.string(),
    joinedAt: a.datetime().required()
  }),

  LeagueMember: a.model({
    leagueId: a.id().required(),
    userId: a.id().required(),
    status: a.enum(['ACTIVE', 'ELIMINATED', 'LEFT']), // Simplified status
    joinedAt: a.datetime().required(),
    eliminatedAt: a.datetime(),
    leftAt: a.datetime(),
    isOwner: a.boolean().default(false),
    isModerator: a.boolean().default(false),
    eliminationHistory: a.json(), // Retained for audit/history of eliminations per race
  }),

  DriverPick: a.model({
    userId: a.id().required(),
    leagueId: a.id().required(),           // Required - no solo mode
    raceId: a.string().required(),
    driverId: a.string().required(),
    // ... other fields
  }),

  // League settings field is retained for future extensibility (e.g., autoPickEnabled, isPrivate, customRules)
  // settings: a.json(),
});
```

- Removed `LifeEvent` model (multiple lives system deprecated)
- Removed lives-related fields from `LeagueMember` model
- Made `leagueId` required in `DriverPick` (no solo mode)
